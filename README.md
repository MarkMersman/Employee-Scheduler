# Employee-Scheduler
This application will create a weekly schedule for a list of employees.
The Username and Password are both Admin.
The application comes with a list of Employees and a list of Shifts already saved in the database file.
When clicking the Schedule button a new schedule is created for the rest of the week, the week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday. This results in nothing showing up in the list if the application is used on a Saturday.
